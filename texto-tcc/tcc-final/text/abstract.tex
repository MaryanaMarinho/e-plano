IFG is a public institution offering primary, professional, and higher education courses.
The teachers of the IFG must present the "Semester Work Plan" semiannually with the planning of the activities to be carried out and their respective schedules according to Resolution number 09, of November 01, 2011.
This resolution preconizes that all data are converted into points weighting factor, being a planning tool both for the teacher and the \acf{DAA} of \ac{IFG}.
However, there is no system to consolidate such a resource, which is currently done using papers based on a sheet and text document models.
A web application called ``{\it e-Plan}'' was developed to address this problem and give a digital solution.
\textit{e}-Plano has been designed to work independently of the operating system, responsive to screen size in the browser and with a user-friendly interface.
These characteristics were achieved by the employment of several software development techniques and methodologies.
The result is a Web application that facilitates the fulfillment of the document ensuring compliance of the "Semester Work Plan" with Resolution 09, from November 01, 2011.
